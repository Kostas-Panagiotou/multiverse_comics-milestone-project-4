# &rarr; **User Experience (UX)**

### **<u>Scope</u>**

The scope of this app is to create a Python and Django-based e-commerce site for an imaginary comic store and collectibles. Multiverse Comics offers the best comics and collectibles at the best prices around here. Multiverse Comics aims to provide all relevant and expected functionality commonly found in e-shops to visitors, as well as an easy-to-use toolset for the site owner, customized to the specific product's demands. The app supports payments via Stripe and uses an AWS S3 bucket for media and static file storage.
### **<u>Design</u>**

**Structure**

- A simple design structure with a fixed navbar, a dropdown side navigation menu accessible from every page and a fixed footer. A brand logo is displayed in the top left of the screen to allow easy navigation back to the homepage.

- As a mobile first site I contained the logo, login button and nav menu icon centered by two spaces creating a core towards the center of the page. This helps keep the design consistent as it moves from smaller to larger viewports.

**Colour palette**

- The white colour has been used for the main background throughout the site with all the forms using a #fafafa shade of white creating a slight contrast.

- Default Bootstrap white (#fff) was used as a background for the navbar as well as the colour of various UI buttons throughout the site. 

- The #fafafa shade of white has been used as a background for cards and forms throughout the app.

- The #000 shade of black has been used as the accent colour for title text throughout the website, as well as the color of more prominent callouts and buttons.

- I decided on this neutral colour scheme as the colours allow the images in the site to stand out more, with images being central to app's function and presentation. 


**Typography**

- The main font used throughout the site is 'Girassol'. The font is pretty strange and fit perfect for comicstore.

**Logo Design**

- A minimal design so as not to visually challenge the images, using typography and css to make it high-res and responsive. 

- Following website conventions, my website logo is a link to the homepage. Over time many people have learned that clicking on a site’s logo leads them back to the homepage so adopting this standard reduces confusion by matching the UI to users’ expectations. The logo is also left-aligned which is the most familiar placement, and is where users look to find it.

## &rarr; **Deployment**

#### <ins>Deploy to Heroku</ins>

The project was deployed to Heroku with all static and media files stored on Amazon S3. I also set up automatic deployment to ensure my Heroku app was always up to date with my GitPod repository.

> **Note:** As all static and media files were stored in an AWS bucket and content was created in admin, these are not available through the GitHub repository. Please contact the site owner if you wish to use any of the images or content included.

<details>
<summary>Deploying to Heroku</summary>
<p>

> **Note:** Before following the below steps ensure you have already created your new repo in Github.

1. Log in (or Register) to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and from your dashboard click 'new' > 'create new app'.

   ![New app btn](readme/media/new-app.png)

2. Enter your 'App name' and choose the appropriate region, then click 'Create app'.
   > **Note:** 
 The app name must be unique, all lowercase, and '-' to be used instead of spaces.
The region chosen should be the one closest to you.

   ![Create new app](readme/media/create-new-app.png)

3. Then on the 'Resources' tab, search and add on the Heroku Postgres database.

4. To use Postgres, install dj_database_url, and psycopg2 in the project terminal using the following commands;

    `$ pip3 install dj_database_url`

    `$ pip3 install psycopg2`

5. Freeze the requirements to ensure Heroku installs all the apps requirements when deployed using the following command;

    `$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

6. To migrate to the Postgres, go to settings.py and add the following import;

    `import dj_database_url`

   Then down in the databases setting comment out the default configuration and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse and give it the database URL from Heroku.

   ![Config Vars](readme/media/database_url.png)

    > **Note:** You can either get the database URL from your config variables in your app settings tab or from the command line by typing Heroku config.

7. Apply all migrations using the following command;

    `$ python3 manage.py migrate`

    After migrations have been applied amend your database configurations to;

    ![Config Vars](readme/media/database_url2.png)

     > **Note:** This will ensure that your Postgres database is used in deployment and your sqlite3 in development.
    
    Your database should now be all set up.

8. Create a superuser to log in with using the following command;

    `$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser`


9. Go to the Settings tab on Heroku, scroll to the 'Config Vars' section, and click 'Reveal Config Vars'. 

   Enter the variables (key and value) contained in your environment settings or stored in an env.py. The keys are listed below and values are inputted by the user.

| Key               | Value               |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | To be added by user |
| AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID | To be added by user |
| USE_AWS           |        TRUE         |
| DATABASE_URL      | To be added by user |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS   | To be added by user |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER   | To be added by user |
| SECRET_KEY        | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET  | To be added by user |

10. Install gunicorn using the following command;

    `$ pip3 install gunicorn`

    Then freeze into your requirements file.

11. Create a Procfile and add the following line;

    `web: gunicorn tabletop_ready.wsgi:application`

    This tells Heroku to create a web dyno which will run gunicorn and serve the Django app.

    > **Note:** The **P**rocfile must be assigned a capital P.

12. Last, you need to temporarily disable collectstatic to ensure that Heroku won't try to collect static files when we deploy. This is done by adding the below variable;

    | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC  | 1 |

13. Add the hostname of your Heroku app to allowed hosts in settings.py

14. Now you can commit all the changes and push to GitHub;

    `$ git add .`
    `$ git commit -m <'your commit message'>`
    `$ git push`

    If you created your app on the website you will need to initialize your Heroku git remote using the following command;

    `$ heroku git:remote -a multiverse-comics`

    Then use the following command to push to Heroku;

    `$ git push heroku master`

<summary>Deploying AWS Static and Media files</summary>
<p>

The project used Amazon Web Services s3, which is a cloud-based storage service, to store static and media files.

1. Create an account by navigating to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and clicking create an AWS account. Fill in your email and password, and a username for your account, and select continue.

2. Now on the account type page, select personal and fill out the required information, click create an account and continue.

3. Next you will be asked to enter a credit card number which will be used for billing if we go above the free usage limits. Beyond this, you'll be asked a couple more verification questions then once all required information is confirmed your account will be created.

   > **Note**: For this project, I didn't go anywhere near the usage limits but keep in mind that AWS is not free if you go above the free usage limits.

4. Now you can navigate back to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign-in to your account.

5. Navigate to AWS management console under my account and using the 'find services' search bar, find s3.

6. Now open s3 and create a new bucket to store all your files.

- Enter a name for your bucket
    > **Note**: I'd recommend naming your bucket to match your Heroku app name.

- Select a region
    > **Note**: Select the region closest to you like you did when creating your Heroku app.

- Uncheck block all public access and acknowledge that the bucket will be public.
    > **Note**: Allows public access to our static files.

- Click create bucket and your bucket should be created.

7. Now click into your new bucket and set some settings;

- On the properties tab and turn on static website hosting.

    > **Note**: For the index and error document, just fill in some default values.

- On the permissions tab 

  - Paste in a **CORS Configuration** to set up the required access between your Heroku app and this s3 bucket. Copy the code below supplied by CodeInstitute;

        [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
                "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
                "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
                "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
        ]

  - In the **Bucket Policy** tab, select policy generator
    - Policy type is 's3 bucket policy'
    - Allow all principles using a *
    - Actions is 'GetObject'
    - Add in your ARN (found on previous page)
    - Click 'Add statement' then 'Generate policy'
    - Copy the policy code and paste it into the bucket policy editor

       > **Note:** To allow access to all resources in this bucket add a slash star onto the end of the resource key.
    
    - Click save

  - In the **Access Control List** tab, under the Public Access section, set the list objects permission to everyone.

8. Create a user to access the bucket created.

- Search for a new service 'IAM'
- Now open IAM, navigate to 'groups' and click 'Create new group'

  > **Note:** You can call your group whatever you want but try to give it a name that makes sense to you for what it is.

- Create a policy by navigating to 'policies' and click 'Create policy'
- Go JSON tab and click 'import managed policy'
  - Search for s3 and then import the s3 full access policy.
    - Replace resource value '*' with your bucket ARN from the bucket policy page;

    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::multiverse-comics",
        "arn:aws:s3:::multiverse-comics/*"
    ]

  - Click 'Review policy', give it a name and a description and click 'Create policy'

9. Attach the policy to the group you created.
- Navigate to 'groups', select the group you created and on permissions tab select 'Attach policy'.
- Search for the policy you created, select it and click 'Attach policy'.

- Now to create the user, navigate to 'users' and click 'Add user'
  - Add username, select programmatic access and click 'Next'
  - Add user to a group by selecting the group you created and click 'Next' then click through to the end and click 'Create user'
  - Now download the CSV file which will contain this users access key and secret access key

    > **Note:** It's very important you download and save this CSV because once you've gone through this process we can't download them again.

10. To connect to Django, head to your project and install two new packages then freeze them into your requirements.txt;
  - $ pip3 install boto3
  - $ pip3 install django-storages
  - $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

11. In settings, add 'storages' to installed apps.

12. To connect Jdango to s3 add the below settings in settings.py which will tell it which bucket it should be communicating with;

        if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
            AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'multiverse-comics'
            AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
            AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'


13. Create a file called custom_storages.py and add the content below;

        from django.conf import settings
        from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


        class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
            location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


        class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
            location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

    Then in settings.py add the below:

        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
        STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
        MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

        STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
        MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

<summary>Setting up Automatic Deployment to Heroku</summary>
<p>

1. From the Heroku deploy tab, select the Deployment method 'GitHub'.
   
2. On the 'Connect to GitHub' section make sure your GitHub profile is displayed then add your repository name and click 'Search'.

    > **Note:** This is the name of your repo in GitHub. It is good practice to use an identical name for your Heroku app.

   3. Your repo should now be displayed below, click 'Connect' to connect to this app.

4. Go to the Deploy tab on Heroku and under the Automatic deployment section, click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'. Then under Manual deploy click 'Deploy Branch'.

   - Heroku will now receive the code from GitHub and start building the app using the required packages.
   - Once built you will receive the message 'Your app was successfully deployed' and you can click 'View' to launch your new app.

        > **Note:** 
        In Manual deploy dropdown 'master' is selected'

</details>

`Sensitive data` for your project can either be stored in your environment settings or be added to an env.py file in your workspace.

<details>
<summary>More details on creating an env.py file</summary> 
<p>

1. Add a env.py file to store environment variables:

    `os.environ.setdefault("Key", "Value")`


| Key               | Value               |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | To be added by user |
| AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID | To be added by user |
| DATABASE_URL      | To be added by user |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS   | To be added by user |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER   | To be added by user |
| SECRET_KEY        | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET  | To be added by user |

 2. Add env.py to your .gitignore file to ensure this file is never pushed to GitHub.
    > **Note:** The env.py mustn't be tracked as any GitHub user can access your confidential data.
